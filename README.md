# Learning OpenGL

This repository documents my journey into **graphics programming using OpenGL**.  
Each concept or milestone is implemented as a **separate Git branch**, making it easy to explore topics step by step.

## Purpose

- Learn the fundamentals of OpenGL
- Practice graphics programming concepts
- Keep a clear history of progress using branches

## Branch Structure

Each branch represents a small, focused project or learning milestone:

- `new_window` — Create and display an OpenGL window
- `hello-triangle` — Render a basic triangle using OpenGL

> New concepts and experiments will continue to be added as separate branches.
